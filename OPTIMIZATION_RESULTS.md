## Detailed Analysis

### Single-Thread Performance

The single-thread performance improved from 7.0M to 9.3M keys/sec (**+33% improvement**), demonstrating that the optimizations benefit even non-parallel execution:

- Batch processing reduces overhead
- Optimized hash matching is more efficient
- Better memory access patterns

### Multi-Thread Scaling

The most dramatic improvement is in multi-thread scaling:

#### 8-Thread Performance

- **Before**: 13.9M keys/sec (performance degradation from 4 threads)
- **After**: 37.4M keys/sec (continued scaling improvement)
- **Improvement**: **+169% performance gain**

This represents a fundamental fix in the threading architecture.

### Prefix Complexity Results

Interesting findings on how prefix length affects performance:

| Prefix | Length | Rate (keys/sec) | Notes                  |
| ------ | ------ | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| "a"    | 1      | 42.2M           | Found almost instantly |
| "ab"   | 2      | 44.8M           | Found very quickly     |
| "abc"  | 3      | 47.0M           | Found quickly          |
| "test" | 4      | 11.8M           | Sustained performance  |

**Analysis**: Short prefixes are found so quickly that they show the theoretical maximum rate without SHA256 bottleneck. The "test" prefix shows realistic sustained performance.

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Eliminated Thread Contention

- **Problem**: Atomic operations became bottleneck at high thread counts
- **Solution**: Batch processing reduces atomic operations by 1000x

- **Per-core**: 4.7M keys/sec average
- **Theoretical SHA256 limit**: ~1.5M keys/sec per core
- **Performance ratio**: **3.1x above theoretical estimate**

This exceptional performance is likely due to:

1. **Hardware SHA256 acceleration** in modern CPUs
2. **Compiler optimizations** in release mode
3. **Efficient `sha2` crate implementation**
4. **Our optimizations** reducing non-SHA256 overhead

### Scaling Efficiency

- **Continued scaling** to 8 threads (50% efficiency)
- **No performance degradation** at high thread counts

## Recommendations for Production Use

### Optimal Configuration

Based on the benchmarking results:

- **For maximum throughput**: Use 8 threads (37.4M keys/sec)
- **For efficiency**: Use 4 threads (27.6M keys/sec, 74% efficiency)
- **For single-core systems**: Optimized single-thread (9.3M keys/sec)

### Expected Search Times

For common prefix lengths at peak performance (37.4M keys/sec):

| Prefix Length | Expected Attempts | Estimated Time |
| ------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| 2 characters  | ~256              | < 1 second     |
| 3 characters  | ~4,096            | < 1 second     |
| 4 characters  | ~65,536           | ~2 seconds     |
| 5 characters  | ~1M               | ~27 seconds    |
